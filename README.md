# SWE437: Software Testing and Maintenance

**Description**
Concepts and techniques for testing and modifying software in evolving environments. Topics include software testing at the unit, module, subsystem, and system levels; developer testing; automatic and manual techniques for generating test data; testing concurrent and distributed software; designing and implementing software to increase maintainability and reuse; evaluating software for change; and validating software changes.

**Required Skills**
- Java
- JUnit
- Maven

Though this course provides extremely practical skills, it is, at heart, an applied math course. Knowledge of discrete math (sets, graphs, logic, and grammars), data structures (e.g., array/linked list, hash/tree maps, hash/tree sets), and basic software engineering are required.
