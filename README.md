# SWE437: Software Testing and Maintenance

**Description**

Concepts and techniques for testing and modifying software in evolving environments. Topics include software testing at the unit, module, subsystem, and system levels; developer testing; automatic and manual techniques for generating test data; testing concurrent and distributed software; designing and implementing software to increase maintainability and reuse; evaluating software for change; and validating software changes.

Though this course provides extremely practical skills, it is, at heart, an applied math course. Knowledge of discrete math (sets, graphs, logic, and grammars), data structures (e.g., array/linked list, hash/tree maps, hash/tree sets), and basic software engineering are required.

**Requirements**
- Java
- JUnit
- Maven
- Data Structures
- Discrete Mathematics
